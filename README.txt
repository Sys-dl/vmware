Elenore Tools
========================
This tool was developed for the purpose of inventorying 
 the information contained in vm-support.
This tool is intended to run on Windows and has not been tested in a Linux environment at this time.
Also, it is loaded with wx modules, so it is assumed to run on GUI and python3 environment.

I thought about uploading the .exe extension, 
 but I thought it would be a unfavorable if users couldn't read the source code.
"pyinstaller" or similar can be converted to an exe extension.
